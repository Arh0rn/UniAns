## Privacy & Data Collection

**We do NOT collect any data. Period.**

-   🔒 **Zero data collection**: This extension does not collect, store, or transmit any user data to our servers (because we don't have any servers!)
-   🔑 **Your API keys stay local**: API keys are stored only in Chrome's sync storage on your device
-   🎯 **Direct API calls**: Your selected text is sent directly to your chosen AI provider's API (OpenAI) - we never see it
-   👁️ **No tracking**: No analytics, no telemetry, no tracking of any kind
-   📝 **Open source**: All code is public and auditable on GitHub

**What the extension accesses:**

-   Only the text you select on a webpage (when you trigger the extension)
-   Your settings stored locally in Chrome

**Where your data goes:**

-   Selected text → Directly to your API provider (using YOUR API key)
-   That's it. We're not in the middle.
